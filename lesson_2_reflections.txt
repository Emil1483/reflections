What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I guess I have to create a commit to start tracking my files. When I initialize a repository, it creates a file called .git that stores all the commits. It also says (master #) after Emil in the prompt.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where I put the files that I want to be in a commit. It acts on the reposetory which is all inside of the working directory. This is where all the files are stored.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can use git diff --staged to find out what changes is between the most recent commit and the staging area. This way, I can check if doing a commit will hace one logical change.
