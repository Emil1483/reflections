When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would do this if I wanted to share my code with the world or when I am collaborating with others on a project. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I do not know what the changes did, so I do not know if it might interfer with my code. Also, if it happened automaticly, it might just confuse me.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones but stored only in GitHub, and branches just make up the forks and clones.
